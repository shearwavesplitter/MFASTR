\usage{
do_station_simple(path, sheader = "t0", type = "normal", filtnum = 3,
  tvelpath = NULL, tvel = ak135_alp, zerophase = FALSE,
  no_threads = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to folder}

\item{sheader}{SAC header the S-wave pick is stored in}

\item{type}{Which of the MFAST default settings and filters to use}

\item{filtnum}{Number of filters to test}

\item{tvelpath}{Path to a .tvel file containing the velocity model (overrides tvel)}

\item{tvel}{A tvel file read with readtvel (ak135_alp and ak135_taupo are already loaded)}

\item{no_threads}{Number of threads to run measurements on. Set to 1 for verbose mode. Defaults to twice the number of cores}
