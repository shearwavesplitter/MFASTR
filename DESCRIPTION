Description: This is a port of the MFAST codes into R. The main functions do_station_simple and do_station_complex replicate MFAST's usability. Other functions in this package are documented to give advanced users more fexability. In contrast to MFAST, MFASTR (by default) uses zerophase filters and does not downsample.
